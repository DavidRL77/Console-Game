# Console-Game
This "game" is more of an engine than anything else. I thought it would be fun to try and make a modular system where the player can create their own worlds by defining files with different components, such as tiles and entities.
You create a world by making a new folder in the C:\Worlds directory, and adding all the necessary files and file structure. The project is vastly unfinished though and doesn't work, so yeah.
