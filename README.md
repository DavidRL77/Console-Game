# Console-Game
This "game" is more of an engine than anything else. I thought it would be fun to try and make a modular system where the player can create their own worlds by defining files with different components, such as tiles and entities.
You create a world by making a new folder in the C:\Worlds directory, and adding all the necessary files and file structure. Maybe I'll make a wiki on how it works, but I don't know if I'll continue this project. Not because I haven't enjoyed it, it's a very fun project, it's just that I'm caught up in other things. I do hope I continue this.
